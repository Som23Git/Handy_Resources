#6 How to ssh to your server?

CMD - ssh -vi "ubuntu_key.pem" ubuntu@ecX-3X-20X-XXX-1.compute-X.amazonaws.com
Where,
v -> verbose
i -> initializing the .pem file.

NOTE: we usually use "chmod 400 ubuntu_key.pem" but, this 400 -> symbolizes to 4 -> Digit place belongs to the Owner(4 is READ), 
0 -> Digit place belongs to Group Users(0 -> NO Permission) and the last 0 -> Belongs to Others(0 -> NO Permission).

#7 Sudo bash vs sudo su -

It is a simple concept. Sudo bash -> This will NOT change the directory when you login to a root user i.e. if you are in a directory /abc/xyz and commanding it 
to sudo bash, then you'll continue with the same directory /abc/xyz but from the root user permissions.
BUT, if you use sudo su -, you will be change to the root permissions and will be starting from the root's HOME directory.

We can use Fstab to mount disk permanently using the UUID, the path, and the filesystem type as such.

NOTE: Fstab -> File System Table.

Why we do this? In case if we are using SSD for OS installation and wanted to mount the mechanical drive 
for storage, we can manually update the Fstab file.

tmpfs          tmpfs  194M  1.5M  193M   1% /run
tmpfs          tmpfs  5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
/dev/xvda15    vfat   105M  5.3M  100M   5% /boot/efi
tmpfs          tmpfs   97M   76K   97M   1% /run/user/116
tmpfs          tmpfs   97M   76K   97M   1% /run/user/1000

The params - Th
-T -> The file system type
-h -> Human Readable format
