We can initiate the GCP VM with the below startup script where it would create an environment for us while the VM is created.

------------------------------------
apt-get update
apt-get install apache2 php php-mysql -y
service apache2 restart
------------------------------------

This above script will update the GCP instance cache which is called as apt-get update
It will install the apache2 php php-mysql -y -> say yes to everything and storing it as php file
Once installed, restarting the apache2 to check everything is working appropriately.

//End
